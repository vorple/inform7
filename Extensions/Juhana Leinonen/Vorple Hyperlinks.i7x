---- DOCUMENTATION ----


There are three kinds of hyperlinks that we can add to the story with this extension: a link to another web site, a link that triggers a parser command, or a link that runs JavaScript code.

In non-Vorple interpreters the links are just plain text that can't be clicked.


Chapter: Links to web sites

Hyperlinks open web pages in new browser windows. The addresses should include the "http://" or "https://" prefix, unless the link is pointing to another file on the same server.

	place a link to web site "http://vorple-if.com" reading "Vorple web page";

An optional "called" part defines the link element's additional classes.

	place a link to web site "http://vorple-if.com" called "system-credits" reading "Vorple web page";
	[creates <a href="http://vorple-if.com" class="system-credits weblink">Vorple web page</a>]

Clicking on the links open the target web page on a new browser window. The link can be opened in the same window by passing an option:

	place a link to web site "http://vorple-if.com" reading "Vorple web page", opening in the same window;

If the story is run in a standard interpreter, the link description text is displayed but not the web site address (and clicking on the text won't do anything).


Chapter: Links to commands

Links to commands by default work just as if they would have been typed on the prompt.

	place a link to command "open door" reading "door";

Leaving out the text content will print the link target instead (so you don't have to write 'place a link to "ask the custodian about the missing artifacts" reading "ask the custodian about the missing artifacts"' and so on).

	say "Feel free to ";
	place a link to command "look";
	say " around.";

The option "without showing the command" runs the command but doesn't show it in the scrollback. The story's response is still printed.

	place a link to command "inventory" reading "my stuff", without showing the command;

In a non-Vorple interpreter only the link text is displayed.


Chapter: Links that execute JavaScript code

Links that execute JavaScript code can be created with the following command:

	place a link to execute the JavaScript command "alert('Hello!')" called "greeting" reading "Hello?";
	
The "called" part is optional.
	
The click event object is available in the execution scope as a variable called "e". The object is the jQuery's event object in response to the click.


Example: * Click to Learn More - Hyperlinks to external web pages, email links and action links, with a fallback if Vorple is not available

Email links ("mailto:") open an external mail program with the address pre-filled.


	*: "Click to Learn More"
	
	Include Vorple Hyperlinks by Juhana Leinonen.
	
	Release along with the "Vorple" interpreter.

	Lounge is a room.

	Getting information is an action out of world.
	Understand "about" and "info" as getting information.

	Carry out getting information:
		say "This fine story has been made possible by ";
		if Vorple is supported:
			place a link to web site "http://vorple-if.com" reading "Vorple";
		otherwise:
			say "Vorple (vorple-if.com)";
		say ". Please contact us at ";
		place a link to web site "mailto:if@example.com" reading "if@example.com";
		say "."

	After looking for the first time:
		say "(Type ";
		place a link to command "ABOUT";
		say " for more information.)[line break]".

	Test me with "about".
		
		
Example: ** Click to Retry - Clickable options when play ends

If the story makes use of hyperlinks, we will probably want the options presented when the play ends be clickable as well. This example replaces the rule in the Standard Rules with one that prints the options as hyperlinks.

Because we can't print the topic entry that contains the actual command, we'll assume that the word written in all caps is the correct command.


	*: "Click to Retry"
	
	Chapter 1 - Clickable end of story options
 
	Include Vorple Hyperlinks by Juhana Leinonen.
	Release along with the "Vorple" interpreter.
	
	This is the clickable print the final question rule:
		let named options count be 0;
		repeat through the Table of Final Question Options:
			if the only if victorious entry is false or the story has ended finally:
				if there is a final response rule entry
					or the final response activity entry [activity] is not empty:
					if there is a final question wording entry, increase named options count by 1;
		if the named options count is less than 1, abide by the immediately quit rule;
		say "Would you like to " (A);
		repeat through the Table of Final Question Options:
			if the only if victorious entry is false or the story has ended finally:
				if there is a final response rule entry 
					or the final response activity entry [activity] is not empty:
					if there is a final question wording entry and final question wording entry matches the regular expression "<A-Z>{2,}":
						place a link to command text matching regular expression reading final question wording entry;
						decrease named options count by 1;
						if the named options count is 1:
							if the serial comma option is active, say ",";
							say " or " (B);
						otherwise if the named options count is 0:
							say "?[paragraph break]";
						otherwise:
							say ", ";
	
	The clickable print the final question rule is listed instead of the print the final question rule in the before handling the final question rulebook.
	
	
	Chapter 2 - Story
	
	The Treasury is a room.	The gem is in the treasury.
	
	After taking the gem:
		end the story finally.
		
	Test me with "take gem".


Example: *** Mood Swings - Changing the text of clicked links

A commonly used technique in modern hypertext IF is to make a linked text cycle through a set of options that changes the story state. For example, clicking on the word "happy" in the text "Alice is happy" changes the sentence to "Alice is sad" without otherwise advancing the story.

Here we do the same thing by making links in character descriptions trigger a hidden command that changes the property called appearance and then changing the link to reflect the new property. The phrase that changes the link ("display text...") is from the core Vorple extension.


	*: "Mood Swings"

	Include Vorple Hyperlinks by Juhana Leinonen.
	Release along with the "Vorple" interpreter.
	
	An appearance is a kind of value. Appearances are confident, energetic, flustered, tired and cheerful. A person has an appearance.
	
	The Savoy Ballroom is a room. Alice is a woman in the ballroom. Bob is a man in the ballroom. Carol is a woman in the ballroom. David is a man in the ballroom.
	
	The description of a person is usually "[The item described] is looking [link to the appearance of the item described]."
	
	To say link to the appearance of (target - person):
		let link name be "appearance-[target]";
		disable all links called link name; [don't let the player click on old links]
		place a link to the command "cycle appearance of [target]" called link name reading "[appearance of the target]" , without showing the command.
		
	Cycling the appearance is an action applying to one visible thing.
	
	Understand  "cycle appearance of [any person]" as cycling the appearance.
	
	Carry out cycling the appearance:
		now the noun is the appearance after the appearance of the noun;
		if Vorple is supported:
			display text "[appearance of the noun]" in the element called "appearance-[noun]".
	
	Report cycling the appearance when Vorple is not supported:
		say "[The noun] is now [appearance of the noun]."

	Test me with "x alice/cycle appearance of alice/g/x alice/x bob/cycle appearance of bob/x bob".
