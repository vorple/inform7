There is a room.


Volume 1 - Extension tests

Book 1 - Vorple

Chapter 1 - Handshake

Carry out unit testing "handshake":
	whether or not Vorple is supported confirms "Vorple support";
	execute JavaScript command "return vorple.version";
	whether or not text returned by the JavaScript command exactly matches the regular expression "\d\.\d{1,2}(\.\d{1,2})?" confirms "Version number ([text returned by the JavaScript command])";


Chapter 2 - User Interface

Vorple interface setup rule:
	set a shared flag "ui setup".

UI state is a list of truth states that varies. UI state is { true, false, false }.

Vorple interface construction rule:
	repeat with N running from 1 to the number of entries in the UI state:
		if entry N in the UI state is true:
			set a shared flag "ui construction [N]";
		otherwise:
			unset a shared flag "ui construction [N]".

Every turn:
	now entry 2 in UI state is true.

Carry out unit testing "state 3 on":
	now entry 3 in UI state is true.

Volume 2 - Testing framework

Book 1 - Unit testing command

Unit testing is an action applying to one topic.
Understand "unittest [text]" as unit testing.

Fail count is a number that varies. Fail count is 0.
Pass count is a number that varies. Pass count is 0.
Run-time error thrown is a truth state that varies. Run-time error thrown is false.
Current test name is text that varies.

[this overrides the error printing in the Vorple extension]
To throw Vorple run-time error (desc – text):
	now run-time error thrown is true.

To start tests for (name - text):
	say "[bold type][name][roman type][line break]";

To name the test (name - text):
	say "  [name]: ";
  now current test name is name.

To pass the test:
	place an inline element called "textcolor-2" reading "PASSED[line break]";
	execute JavaScript command "passI7Test()";
	increment pass count.

To fail the test:
	place an inline element called "textcolor-4" reading "FAILED[line break]";
	execute JavaScript command "failI7Test('[escaped current test name]')";
	increment fail count.

To fail the test expecting (x - text) to be (y - text):
	place an inline element called "textcolor-4" reading "FAILED";
	if x is "":
		now x is "(empty)";
	if y is "":
		now y is "(empty)";
	say " - expected [x] to be [y][line break]";
	execute JavaScript command "failI7Test('[escaped current test name]')";
	increment fail count.

To (x - truth state) confirms (msg - text):
	name the test msg;
	if x is true:
		pass the test;
	otherwise:
		fail the test.

To expect (x - text) to be (y - text) which confirms (msg - text):
 	name the test msg;
 	if x is y:
 		pass the test;
 	otherwise:
 		fail the test expecting x to be y.

To expect (x - number) to be (y - number) which confirms (msg - text):
	expect "[x]" to be "[y]" which confirms msg.

To expect (x - truth state) to be (y - truth state) which confirms (msg - text):
	expect "[x]" to be "[y]" which confirms msg.

Test result expectations is a list of text that varies.

To expect test result (msg - text):
	add msg to test result expectations.

To resolve test result (msg - text):
	remove msg from test result expectations;
	say "  [msg]: ";
	pass the test.


Book 2 - Flags

Setting a flag is an action out of world applying to a topic.

Understand "set flag [text]" as setting a flag.

Carry out setting a flag:
	set a shared flag topic understood.

To set a shared flag (flag name - text):
	execute JavaScript command "window.testFlags[bracket]'[escaped flag name]'[close bracket] = true".

To unset a shared flag (flag name - text):
	execute JavaScript command "window.testFlags[bracket]'[escaped flag name]'[close bracket] = false".

First Vorple interface setup rule (this is the create the flag object rule):
	execute JavaScript command "window.testFlags = {}".
